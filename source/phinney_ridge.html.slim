      | Phinney Ridge is a long, elevated bit of land that runs north-south
      |  through the city, dividing
      a<>(href='/green_lake.html') Green Lake
      |  and
      a<>(href='/wallingford.html') Wallingford
      |  from
      a<>(href='/ballard.html') Ballard
      |  and
      a<(href='/fremont.html') Fremont
      | . Phinney Ave., which turns into Greenwood Ave. as it continues north
      |  through the neighborhood, is the main arterial street running through
      |  the neighborhood. From that street at the top of the ridge, you can see both west to the Olympic Mountains on the peninsula, and east to the Cascades.

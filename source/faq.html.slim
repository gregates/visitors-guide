    h2 How’s the weather?

    p
      | Seattle’s climate is “
      a(href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_climate' target='_blank')Mediterranean
      |” [external link], which means mild, wet winters and dry summers.
    p
      | Seattle’s reputation as a rainy city comes from these winters. But in terms of total annual precipitation by volume, Seattle is behind a lot of east cost and midwestern cities &mdash; Indianapolis, Boston, Atlanta, New York, and Houston all get more precipitation than Seattle in a typical year.
    p
      | What Seattle does have is a lot of cloudy days with some light rain. Only Portland, Pittsburgh, Buffalo, and Cleveland have as many rainy days in an average year among major U.S. cities. When you also factor in cloudy days, Seattle ends up tied with Buffalo for the #1 spot on the “

      |” [external link].
    p
      | Because rain is frequent but light, and because of the possibility of high winds, it’s common in Seattle to skip the umbrella and just wear a rainproof jacket and waterproof shoes when out and about. These items are only truly necessary in the winter (say, October through April); the summers are relatively dry and sunny. If you’re here in the summer, make sure you bring sunglasses and wear sunscreen.
    p
      | Temperatures in Seattle are mild all year round. In winter, no month has an average temperature below freezing (but we do get snow maybe once a year). In the summer, it will get hot occasionally, but most places (including our home) do not have air conditioning. The average high temperature even in August is only 77°F (25°C).
    p
      | If you’re planning on traveling into the mountains, of course, the weather will be much colder, and you will definitely run into snow throughout the winter (you must have tire chains if crossing the Cascades via I-5 in the winter). This is one of the great things about Seattle winters! The city has mild winters, but winter sports are a short drive away.

    h2 When should I visit?

  article
    p
      | All else being equal, we recommend visiting Seattle in the summer: May through September. Summers here are beautiful and mild. The days are long &mdash; near the solstice, the sun doesn’t set until after 9 p.m., and we get 16 total hours of daylight. This is the best season for enjoying our back yard and patio!
    p
      | The winter, by contrast, is dark and dreary. It rains frequently, and when it doesn’t it’s usually cloudy. Near the winter solstice, the sun sets shortly after 4 p.m., and we only get a little over 8 hours of daylight.
    p
      | That said, if you like winter sports, the winter can be a great time to visit. There’s skiing, snowshoeing, and other winter activities just a couple hours from Seattle.

      | Some other seasonal interests you might consider include:

        | Cherry trees blossom here in late March and early April. They’re everywhere (including our back yard!) and they’re beautiful.

        | For hiking in the mountains, you’ll want to come later in the summer, July through September &mdash; some roads will still be closed even in May and June.

    h2 What is “walking distance”?

  article
    p
      | We recognize that not everyone has the same physical ability or desire to walk around the city. We live a car-free lifestyle here in Seattle, but this is unusual: the
      a<>(href='https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/data/seattles-car-population-has-finally-peaked/' target='_blank') Seattle Times
      | [external link] reports that Seattle has more cars-per-person than other major U.S. cities!

    p
      | When we say “walking distance” in this guide, we generally mean a round-trip of 3 miles or less, possibly including elevation change (walking anywhere from our home means going up- or downhill). That’s what we tend to find walkable, but it may not be walkable for everyone.

  header#parking
    h2 Where can I park?

  article
    p
      | We do not have a dedicated parking space at our home. There is usually street parking available (no permit required), though it may be necessary to park a block or two away. Our neighborhood is safe and quiet. We recommend parking uphill, rather than downhill, from the house.
    p
      | Generally speaking, expect to pay for parking in the city center. We recommend taking public transit or a ride-share vehicle when possible, if traveling within the city.

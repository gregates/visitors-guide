The northern parts of the neighborhood are mostly residential, though the curious can find a variety of restaurants, bars, and shops sprinkled throughout.</p><p> <a href="https://www.seattle.gov/parks/find/parks/golden-gardens-park" target="_blank">Golden Gardens Park</a> in the northwest corner is a popular beach park with great sunset views of the Olympic Mountains across the Puget Sound. But Ballard's waterfront is still largely given over to industry. The extremely popular <a href="https://www.seattle.gov/parks/find/parks/burke-gilman-trail" target="_blank">Burke-Gilman trail</a> runs from near the Shilshole Bay Marina along the waterfront all the way to Lake Washington and eventually the suburb of Bothell. However, in Ballard's industrial zone the trail has an infamous “missing link,” where you must leave the trail for a time.</p></article></section></body></html>

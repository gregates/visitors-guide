We're also within <a href="faq.html#walking_distance">walking distance</a> of the <a href="ballard.html">Ballard</a>, <a href="wallingford.html">Wallingford</a>, <a href="green_lake.html">Green Lake</a>, and <a href="fremont.html">Fremont</a> neighborhoods.</p><p>We are privileged to have a home that sits on the slope of the ridge, meaning that we have an excellent view of the Olympic Mountains on the peninsula, across the Puget Sound. We get ample sunlight in the afternoons and evenings, and the sunsets are frequently stunning. We have tried to capture the view in photographs, but none of them do it justice.</p><img alt="the view from our window" height="836" src="images/window.jpg" width="960" /><p>The street climbs quite steeply past our house and is not a popular thoroughfare. Car noise is minimal &mdash; you’re more likely to notice the son of our neighbors up the street practicing violin than traffic.</p></article></section><section><header><h2>Backyard</h2></header><article><img alt="our cherry trees" height="720" src="images/cherry_trees.jpg" width="960" /><p>While the view from our backyard is somewhat obstructed by our neighbor's house, the backyard is pleasant in its own right. We have two beautiful cherry trees that blossom in the spring, and a covered patio with seating for six.</p><img alt="the back patio" height="720" src="images/patio.jpg" width="960" /><p>That’s a grape vine on the fence between our yard and the neighbors’!</p></article></section><section><header><h2>Amenities</h2></header><article><p>The house has a relatively private unit in the ground level with its own entrance, a queen-size bed, a private bathroom, and a partial kitchen (refrigerator and sink, no stove). Temperatures in this area tend to be cooler than the rest of the house, and heat is shared with the main level. A space heater is available. Access to the rest of the house is through the basement.</p><p>We also have a guest bedroom with a full-size bed on the upper level, though at this time that room lacks a door and isn't very private. The upper level can get hot on warm, sunny days. Like most homes in Seattle, we do not have air conditioning.</p><p>Laundry is available in the basement.</p><p>We don’t have a dedicated parking space or garage. Limited street parking is available, and does not require a permit or have a time limit. If you're willing to walk a block or two, you should be able to find street parking in the neighborhood except in unusual circumstances. We recommend parking uphill from our home.</p></article></section><section><header><h2>Read next…</h2></header><article><a class="button" href="index.html">Back to Visitor Guide home page</a><a class="button" href="phinney_ridge.html">Phinney Ridge</a><a class="button" href="green_lake.html">Green Lake</a><a class="button" href="ballard.html">Ballard</a><a class="button" href="fremont.html">Fremont</a><a class="button" href="wallingford.html">Wallingford</a><a class="button" href="faq.html">Frequently Asked Questions</a></article></section></body></html>

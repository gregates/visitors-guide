The Fremont Bridge is a pedestrian and bicycle-friendly drawbridge, with stairs leading up to it from the  <a href="https://www.seattle.gov/parks/find/parks/burke-gilman-trail" target="_blank">Burke-Gilman trail</a>. The larger and higher span is Aurora Ave. N/State Route 99, and is best avoided unless traveling by car. North of the Fremont Bridge and along the waterfront is where most of Fremont's bars, restaurants, and shops are located.</p><p>One of Fremont's most famous sights is located beneath the Aurora Ave. bridge: a large concrete statue of a troll crushing a Volkswagen. Fremont is also famous for the annual Solstice Parade in June, best known for its nude, body-painted bicyclists.</p></article></section><section><header><h2>Read next…</h2></header><article><a class="button" href="index.html">Back to Visitor Guide home page</a><a class="button" href="phinney_ridge.html">Phinney Ridge</a><a class="button" href="green_lake.html">Green Lake</a><a class="button" href="ballard.html">Ballard</a><a class="button" href="wallingford.html">Wallingford</a><a class="button" href="faq.html">Frequently Asked Questions</a></article></section></body></html>
